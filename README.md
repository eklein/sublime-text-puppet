sublime-text-puppet
===================
This is a Sublime Text (2) plugin to add support for Puppet syntax highlighting.
It's a fork from arioch's sublime-text-puppet which is a fork from Brice Figureau's
puppet-textmate-bundle repository with a few changes to make it work in Sublime Text 2.

I do not wish to take any credit for his (and others') hard work.
