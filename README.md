sublime-text-puppet
===================
This is a Sublime Text 2 plugin to add support for Puppet syntax highlighting.
It's a fork from arioch's sublime-text-puppet which is a fork from Brice Figureau's
puppet-textmate-bundle repository with a few changes to make it work in Sublime Text 2.

I do not wish to take any credit for his (and others') hard work.

Installation instructions:
--------------------------
Copy the Puppet directory inside the Packages folder in your sublime data directory:

#####  (osx)
  ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/ Packages

#####  (ubuntu/linux)
  ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages

#####  (windows)
  %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages

Restart sublime and you should be good to go.  You can manually set
puppet syntax highlighting if it's necessary.
